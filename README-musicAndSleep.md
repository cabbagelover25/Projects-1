# COGS-138-Project

Sleep and Music

Many of our final project files were done using Google Colab because of the sheer size of our data and an 
inability to download them to our computers. Google Colab was extremely useful and we got to learn a lot about
Google Drive tools and being able to directly connect to the massive amount of files we had there. So while
many of the initial analyzes were done on Github, a lot of the final documentation and meaningful analysis was done there.
